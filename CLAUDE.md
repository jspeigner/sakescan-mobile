<stack>
  Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.76.7, bun (not npm).
  React Query for server/async state.
  NativeWind + Tailwind v3 for styling.
  react-native-reanimated v3 for animations (preferred over Animated from react-native).
  react-native-gesture-handler for gestures.
  lucide-react-native for icons.
  All packages are pre-installed. DO NOT install new packages unless they are @expo-google-font packages or pure JavaScript helpers like lodash, dayjs, etc.
</stack>

<structure>
  src/app/          — Expo Router file-based routes (src/app/_layout.tsx is root). Add new screens to this folder.
  src/components/   — Reusable UI components. Add new components to this folder.
  src/lib/          — Utilities: cn.ts (className merge), example-context.ts (state pattern)
</structure>

<typescript>
  Explicit type annotations for useState: `useState<Type[]>([])` not `useState([])`
  Null/undefined handling: use optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`
  Include ALL required properties when creating objects — TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
</typescript>

<environment>
  Development in Cursor with Expo: use `bun` for scripts (e.g. `bun start`); Metro typically uses port 8081.
  Configure secrets and public values in a root `.env` using `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` names; restart the dev server after changing env vars.
  Prefer implementing and verifying changes in the repo yourself (including running commands when useful).
  When the user is non-technical, explain in plain language. If a request is vague or ambitious, narrow it to concrete steps or features.
  For placeholder images, URLs from unsplash.com are appropriate.
</environment>

<routing>
  Expo Router for file-based routing. Every file in src/app/ becomes a route.
  Never delete or refactor RootLayoutNav from src/app/_layout.tsx.
  
  <stack_router>
    src/app/_layout.tsx (root layout), src/app/index.tsx (matches '/'), src/app/settings.tsx (matches '/settings')
    Use <Stack.Screen options={{ title, headerStyle, ... }} /> inside pages to customize headers.
  </stack_router>
  
  <tabs_router>
    Only files registered in src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx become actual tabs.
    Unregistered files in (tabs)/ are routes within tabs, not separate tabs.
    Nested stacks create double headers — remove header from tabs, add stack inside each tab.
    At least 2 tabs or don't use tabs at all — single tab looks bad.
  </tabs_router>
  
  <router_selection>
    Games should avoid tabs — use full-screen stacks instead.
    For full-screen overlays/modals outside tabs: create route in src/app/ (not src/app/(tabs)/), 
    then add `<Stack.Screen name="page" options={{ presentation: "modal" }} />` in src/app/_layout.tsx.
  </router_selection>
  
  <rules>
    Only ONE route can map to "/" — can't have both src/app/index.tsx and src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx.
    Dynamic params: use `const { id } = useLocalSearchParams()` from expo-router.
  </rules>
</routing>

<state>
  React Query for server/async state. Always use object API: `useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn })`.
  Never wrap RootLayoutNav directly.
  React Query provider must be outermost; nest other providers inside it.
  
  Use `useMutation` for async operations — no manual `setIsLoading` patterns.
  Wrap third-party lib calls (RevenueCat, etc.) in useQuery/useMutation for consistent loading states.
  Reuse query keys across components to share cached data — don't create duplicate providers.
  
  For local state, use Zustand. However, most state is server state, so use React Query for that.
  Always use a selector with Zustand to subscribe only to the specific slice of state you need (e.g., useStore(s => s.foo)) rather than the whole store to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Make sure that the value returned by the selector is a primitive. Do not execute store methods in selectors; select data/functions, then compute outside the selector.
  For persistence: use AsyncStorage inside context hook providers. Only persist necessary data.
  Split ephemeral from persisted state to avoid hydration bugs.
</state>

<safearea>
  Import from react-native-safe-area-context, NOT from react-native.
  Skip SafeAreaView inside tab stacks with navigation headers.
  Skip when using native headers from Stack/Tab navigator.
  Add when using custom/hidden headers.
  For games: use useSafeAreaInsets hook instead.
</safearea>

<data>
  Catalog and user-facing product data come from Supabase; do not add local mock sake/brewery databases in the repo.
  For image analysis: actually send to LLM don't mock.
</data>

<design>
  Don't hold back. This is mobile — design for touch, thumb zones, glanceability.
  Inspiration: iOS, Instagram, Airbnb, Coinbase, polished habit trackers.

  <avoid>
    Purple gradients on white, generic centered layouts, predictable patterns.
    Web-like designs on mobile. Overused fonts (Space Grotesk, Inter).
  </avoid>

  <do>
    Cohesive themes with dominant colors and sharp accents.
    High-impact animations: progress bars, button feedback, haptics.
    Depth via gradients and patterns, not flat solids.
    Install `@expo-google-fonts/{font-name}` for fonts (eg: `@expo-google-fonts/inter`)
    Use zeego for context menus and dropdowns (native feel). Lookup the documentation on zeego.dev to see how to use it.
  </do>
</design>

<mistakes>
  <styling>
    Use Nativewind for styling. Use cn() helper from src/lib/cn.ts to merge classNames when conditionally applying classNames or passing classNames via props.
    CameraView, LinearGradient, and Animated components DO NOT support className. Use inline style prop.
    Horizontal ScrollViews will expand vertically to fill flex containers. Add `style={{ flexGrow: 0 }}` to constrain height to content.
  </styling>

  <camera>
    Use CameraView from expo-camera, NOT the deprecated Camera import.
    import { CameraView, CameraType, useCameraPermissions } from 'expo-camera';
    Use style={{ flex: 1 }}, not className.
    Overlay UI must be absolute positioned inside CameraView.
  </camera>

  <react_native>
    No Node.js buffer in React Native — don't import from 'buffer'.
  </react_native>

  <ux>
    Use Pressable over TouchableOpacity.
    Use custom modals, not Alert.alert().
    Ensure keyboard is dismissable and doesn't obscure inputs. This is much harder to implement than it seems. You can use the react-native-keyboard-controller package to help with this. But, make sure to look up the documentation before implementing.
  </ux>

  <outdated_knowledge>
    Your react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler training may be outdated. Look up current docs before implementing.
  </outdated_knowledge>
</mistakes>

<appstore>
  Store releases use Expo EAS Build / Submit plus Apple App Store Connect and Google Play Console. Follow current Expo, Apple, and Google documentation for signing, metadata, and review. Do not commit secrets or keys.
</appstore> 

<skills>
You have access to a few skills in the `.claude/skills` folder. Use them to your advantage.
- ai-apis-like-chatgpt: Use this skill when the user asks you to make an app that requires an AI API.
- expo-docs: Use this skill when the user asks you to use an Expo SDK module or package that you might not know much about.
- frontend-app-design: Use this skill when the user asks you to design a frontend app component or screen.

<sakescan_app>
This is SakeScan - a "Vivino for Sake" mobile app.

Key features:
- Camera scanning with expo-camera + OpenAI Vision (client `openai-scan` / Edge Function `scan-label`)
- Browse/search sake from Supabase in Explore and related screens
- Detailed sake pages with ratings, reviews, and DB-backed descriptions
- Profile with Supabase Auth and scan history
- Beautiful UI with red accent color (Hinomaru crimson #BC002D), dark mode support, haptics

Navigation structure:
- (tabs)/index.tsx - Scan home screen
- (tabs)/explore.tsx - Browse/search sake
- (tabs)/profile.tsx - User profile
- camera.tsx - Camera scanning screen (full screen modal)
- sake/[id].tsx - Dynamic sake detail screen

Future enhancements needed:
- Optional on-device OCR (ML Kit) as an alternative to cloud vision
- Richer retailer / purchase flows
- Expanded review and flavor metadata from the database
